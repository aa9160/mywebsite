Società Sportiva Calcio Napoli, commonly referred to as simply Napoli, the most successful football club in Southern Italy and among the major clubs in the Italian Serie A, has a long history, which spans from its foundation in 1905 as Naples Foot-Ball Club to the present day.

Napoli has been refounded a number of times during its history, the most recent of which was in 2004, they have spent the majority of their history in Serie A. The club is perhaps most famous for the period when Diego Maradona was a member, between the 1980s and early 1990s, during which he won several awards, including the scudetto and the Coppa Italia twice; they also had success in Europe, where they captured the UEFA Cup.

From Naples to Internaples
Football was first brought to the city of Naples by English sailors during the early 1900s: the first two clubs were Football Club Partenopeo and Naples Foot-Ball & Cricket Club, both founded in 1905.

The origins of Naples FCC can be traced back to William Poths,[1] an Englishman employed by maritime agency named Cunard Lines, he was an avid amateur footballer in his spare time and decided to found a club while in Italy. A meeting was called at via San Severino 43 in Naples, with the intentions of creating one; Poths, along with fellow Englishman Mr. Bayon and three Neapolitans called Conforti, Catterina and Amedeo Salsi, formed Naples FCC;[2][3] Salsi was nominated as the first ever president.[4]


Original Naples kit
Their first kit consisted of a sky blue and navy blue striped shirt, with black shorts.[5] Naples played their debut match against British sailors from a ship named Arabik, they competed for a trophy named in honour of Naples first president "Coppa Salsi". Naples were victorious winning the game 3–2, a feat made all the more impressive when considering Arabik had beaten the famed Genoa 3–0 just days earlier. The Naples team that day was;[2]

 	
Kock – Goalkeeper
Garozzo – Defender
Del Pezzo – Defender
Littie – Defender
 	
Steinecaer – Defender
Marin – Midfielder
Scarfoglio – Midfielder
McPherson – Midfielder
 	
Chaudorir – Midfielder
Poths – Forward
Ostermann – Forward
One year after its foundation, the "Cricket" part of the name was dropped leaving the club's name as simply Naples Foot-Ball Club. In 1909, Sir Thomas Lipton, of the famous Lipton tea brand, was visiting Sicily while travelling with his ship; he set up a competition called the Lipton Challenge Cup. In this competition, Neapolitan and Sicilian teams faced off against each other annually; the majority of the finals saw Naples playing Palermo Foot-Ball Club. Naples won the competition in the opening season, with a 4–2 result. The trophy was disputed six times in total, with Naples also winning it in 1911 and 1914.[6]
